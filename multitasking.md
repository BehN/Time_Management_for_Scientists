Therefore, if the enemy prepares to defend the front, the back will be weak. If he prepares to defend the back, the front will be weak. If he prepares to defend the left, the right will be weak. If he prepares to defend the right, the left will be weak. If he prepares to defend everywhere, everywhere will be weak.

Psychological studies support that multitasking does not save time. Switching between tasks may result in a loss of productivity (Rubinsteim, Meyer, and Evans, 2001). Also, your concentration may suffer in the long run.

Therefore, the purpose of many time management techniques is to help you avoid multitasking.
