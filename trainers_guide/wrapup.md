# Question & Anwser Session

Towards the end of the workshop, there are three questions left:

1. What have you learned?
2. What have you not covered?
3. What questions are open?

Doing a Q & A Session is a format that lets you cover all three. Time is relatively easy to control, because you can stop the discussion at any point. 

### Time required

10' to 30' depending on the group.


### Starting the Q & A session

* Explain you will have a question & answer session as the final part of the workshop
* Show them the the three questions above
* Ask participants to discuss the questions among each other for 1-2 minutes

### Cue cards

If your group is small and not too exhausted, the discussion may run by itself. However, if it doesn't, you need to stimulate it a little.

Prepare a set of index cards with 9-12 keywords. Have each participant draw a card and either explain what is on it or ask a question. 

#### Labels for the cards

* Activity Log
* SMART Goals
* Covey Matrix
* Five Options
* Saying No
* Pomodoro
* Kanban
* Four Gears of Work
* Time Fairy

and

* Decluttering
* Scheduling
* Discipline
* Long-term goals
* Project management

### Collecting open questions

Note open questions on a board or flipchart.
