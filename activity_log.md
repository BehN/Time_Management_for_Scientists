![Activity Log](images/activity_log.png)

The *activity log* or *time log* is a tool that helps you to:

* become aware how you use your time
* identify time wasters
* raise your awareness on your time working
* start improving your time management

### How to do it

* create an empty table
* note every half hour what you have been doing
* repeat the process for a couple of days
* evaluate the result (e.g. categorizing)

There are plenty of tools (forms, programs, mobile apps etc.) that support keeping a time log. But in principle an empty sheet of paper does the job, too.
