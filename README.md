# Time Management for Scientists

## Who is this ebook for?

This ebook is for scientists who would like to improve their usage of time. It contains basic time management tools that help you to become more productive or more relaxed (which in turn will make you more productive). 

I wrote everything here with the needs of PhD students and postdocs in life science laboratories in mind. You may find it useful if you work in a different field, although you may find the biologists' humour hard to understand.

## How to read this book

You can use this ebook in at least three ways:

* **You are curious** to try a few time management tools. Great! You will find them here.
* **You attended a course** and want to review what you learned there.
* **You want to give a course** for other scientists. Please take a look at the **Trainers Guide** at the end of the book.

I hope the time you spend reading this ebook will be time well spent ;-)
